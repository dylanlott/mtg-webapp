# AngularJS/Compass Seed Project


## Initial Setup

Install [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started).
```
gem install bundler
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Clone the project:
```
git clone git@bitbucket.org:bluehazetech/angular-compass-seed.git
```

The following commands should be run from the new "angular-compass-seed" folder.

Install all Ruby dependencies defined in Gemfile:
```
bundle install
```

Install all nodeJS dependencies defined in package.json:
```
npm install
```


## Development

For live development:

```
grunt dev
```

To render your static file output to the ```/dist/``` directory:

```
grunt dist
```

To run Jasmine tests:

```
grunt test
```


## End to end testing

We recommend using [protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor) for end-to-end tests. It
uses native events and has special features for Angular applications.

Requires a webserver, node.js + `./scripts/web-server.js` or your backend server that hosts the angular static files.

* create your end-to-end tests in `test/e2e/scenarios.js`
* serve your project directory with your http/backend server or node.js + `scripts/web-server.js`
* to run:
  * run the tests from console with [Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor) via
    `scripts/e2e-test.sh` (on windows: `scripts\e2e-test.bat`)
